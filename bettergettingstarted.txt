If you're looking for customized announcement processing with a sleek look, the FHS app is your new best friend. All it takes to get rolling is a little bit of tinkering. 

First, head to the settings page. Pick out your classes (handily sorted by teacher and period) and any clubs or sports you're involved with. These determine which announcements you'll receive, so don't sign up for anything you don't want to hear about. You'll recieve the general announcements by default, so no worries there. 

You can use the slideout menu to navigate around the app, and view specific pages pertaining to only one category of announcements. The app has other goodies like a school-events calendar and links to resources, so be sure to look around. 

If you're not getting any announcements from some subscriptions, it may be that the subscribed teacher just isn't putting them in! Have your teachers ask the FHS app team to get started with our brand-new admin-side system. For other general comments or complaints, contact us at fhsapp@gmail.com. Happy hunting!
